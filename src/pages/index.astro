<Layout title="Computer Science Notes">
    <p>
        I have been studying Computer Science and thought I'd share some of my notes. Not only do I revist them from time to time,
        but I hope they can help you in your journey.
    </p>

        <strong>Note:</strong> I've intentionally designed this site with minimal styling. CSS styling really takes away a lot of my developer time.
